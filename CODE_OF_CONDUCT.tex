\section{Contributor Covenant Code of
Conduct}\label{contributor-covenant-code-of-conduct}

\subsection{Our Pledge}\label{our-pledge}

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our
project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone,
regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and
expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race,
religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

\subsection{Our Standards}\label{our-standards}

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Using welcoming and inclusive language
\item
  Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
\item
  Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
\item
  Focusing on what is best for the community
\item
  Showing empathy towards other community members
\end{itemize}

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual
  attention or advances
\item
  Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political
  attacks
\item
  Public or private harassment
\item
  Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or
  electronic address, without explicit permission
\item
  Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Our Responsibilities}\label{our-responsibilities}

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of
acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair
corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit,
or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other
contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban
temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they
deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

\subsection{Scope}\label{scope}

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public
spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.
Examples of representing a project or community include using an
official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media
account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or
offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and
clarified by project maintainers.

\subsection{Enforcement}\label{enforcement}

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may
be reported by contacting the project team at nescafestories@gmail.com.
The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will
respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The
project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the
reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement
policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in
good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined
by other members of the project's leadership.

\subsection{Attribution}\label{attribution}

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the
\href{http://contributor-covenant.org}{Contributor Covenant}, version
1.4, available at
\href{http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/}{http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4}
